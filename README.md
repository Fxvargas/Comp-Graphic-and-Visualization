# Comp-Graphic-and-Visualization

This project has allowed me to see how graphics are processed in an application and how a graphics card knows what to output. Since I am not going for any sort of career in graphics design, this project provided me with a good introduction to this. A lot of the code in this project can be re-used, including the code that creates the lighting and one that holds the vertices to draw the shapes. Throughout the course, most of the code built along each other, each time adding to the code's functionality, like when later on in the course we added the ability to move the camera around the scene rather than having a stationary camera.

The skills earned from working on this project is visualizing how a graphics card or on board graphics knows what to draw. Each of the shapes are basically points connected on an X-Y-Z coordinate.
